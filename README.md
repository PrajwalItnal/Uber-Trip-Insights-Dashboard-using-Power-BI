## 📘 Project Overview

This project analyzes **Uber trip data** to uncover meaningful trends and patterns using **Microsoft Power BI**. The goal is to transform raw trip information into actionable insights that help understand ride demand, peak usage times, and location-based trip distribution.

Data cleaning and transformation were performed using **Power Query** inside Power BI. The cleaned and modeled data is then used to create an **interactive and informative dashboard** that highlights key performance indicators (KPIs) and visualizes trends in Uber trip activity.

✔ Analysis of trip distribution across time (hour/day/month)  
✔ Identification of peak hours and high-traffic locations  
✔ Visual KPIs showing total trips, revenue (if available), and trends  
✔ User-friendly visuals for data exploration

## 📥 How to Use

1. **Clone or download** this repository  
2. Make sure dataset files are in the `/dataset` folder  
3. Open `UberDashboard.pbix` in Power BI Desktop  
4. Refresh the report to load data from the updated path  
5. Explore visuals and slicers interactively  

---

## 📌 Notes

- The Power BI file is linked to the dataset using a relative path so that refreshing data works if PBIX and dataset files are kept together.  
- PBIX may show errors if the dataset is moved without updating the source via **Transform Data → Data source settings → Change Source**.
